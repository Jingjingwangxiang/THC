It supports the results we presented in our review paper submitted to Water Resources Research in July 2025 titled “A Comprehensive Review of Temperature Effects on Reaction Transport.”

The underlying source code and models that produced the manuscript figures are summarized below:

SourceCode.zip contains the source code developed to simulate thermal retardation and thermal convection effects on RT, also available at .

The files named Model_.zip contain the input and output data for the results of thermal retardation and thermal convection effects on RT.

Figures.zip contains the MATLAB codes that generate the figures.
