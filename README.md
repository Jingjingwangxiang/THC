It supports the results we presented in our paper submitted to the Hydrogeology Journal in January 2026 titled “A discussion of temperature effects on reactive transport”.

Software development platform: Microsoft Visual Studio 2022

Program language: object-oriented programming FORTRAN2003

Compiler: Intel oneAPI 2022

Library: Intel Math Kernel Library (Intel® MKL).

The underlying source code and models that produced the manuscript figures are summarized below:

SourceCode.zip contains the source code developed to simulate thermal retardation and thermal convection effects on RT.

The files named Model_.zip and Model5_.zip contain the input and output data for the results of thermal retardation and thermal convection effects on RT, respectively.

Figures.zip contains the MATLAB codes that generate the figures.
